Comment List - pass down a list  (comment data) it will map over it and for each comment it will return data=comment

Challenges in Live data:
1. Get Data Live
2. Update the UI

There are two ways to handle Live Data:

1. Web Sockets: It is 2 way connection ,quickly send data from either side from ui to backend and vice versa (birectional live data)  (handshake similar)  (eg- live trading platform eg- zerodha,whatsapp)

UI<------------->Server

2.API Polling
-UI requests the server and data flows from server to UI after and interval . (In websockets there is no interval)
- eg- let me check after each 10 sec if new data came up or not. (like in Email services, Crickbuzz) 
- Youtube live chat- API Polling - making calls each 1.5sec

UI layer-

why Page is not exploding- because after a certain time youtube cleans up the data  (it is not storing the data in the dom)
It also depends on the browser - for eg : Internet Explorer , youtube stores less no of live chats as it is old browser.
